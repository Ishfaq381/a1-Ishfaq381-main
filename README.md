# Rock Paper Scissors

As you are not familier will everything we are doing here, 
don't edit any file other than `assignment.js` and only where you are expected to put your code

## What to do?

1. Open the terminal in VS Code. (Terminal > New Terminal)
2. Install all the required thing by running this command:

       npm install

    NOTE: An active internet connection is required and only needs to be done once.

3. Update `assignment.js` and fix the code.
4. Run unittests.

       npm run test

    This will run tests locally in the same way as your assignemt will be evaulated when you submit the assignment

5. Make sure your code is clean

       npm run lint
